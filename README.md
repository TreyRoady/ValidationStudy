# ValidationStudy
Experimental treatment files for FAA research into vibrotactile signals.

Current version: 0.9 -> Pre Pilot Study

Study is currently comparing vibrotactile signals that vary based on frequency and temporal spacing.
Additionally, we'll be validating whether individuals can interpret vibrotactile music and identify familiar songs.

This study's goal is to identify a candidate signal set which demonstrates a strong underlying transitive order 
(A > B, B > C, ergo A > C). The signals will then be used to determine how many levels of vibrational signal pilots
can interpret while under cognitive load.


Current Version: 
- All signals are programmed and tested.
- Needs pilot testing to verify study reliability
